## Phase 5: Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
-  [X] **Frontend Development:**
    -   [X] In "Create New RFP", there is no option to add documents ??? why , while creating RFP, user will surely going to upload documents related to RFP
    -   [X] In "login" and "register" Page, if token is there in the localstorage, please redirect to dashboard page and After "login"& "Register" redirect to dashboard page as well. 
    -   [X] when I am going to "/dashboard" page, why it is redirect me to login page even if token is there, fix this. this is happening for every protected page. check the logic and do it 
    -   [X] In dashboard, why we have different Upload Documents Actions for Buyer to upload documents ?? better is to make them inside "Create New RFP".. why there are two "Review Responses" actions ??? remove one if other one is redudant
    -   [X] While uploading document "file_type" key is mandatory to send from the frontend. please do it.
    -   [X] You have not implemented every detail in RFP details page.... Detail RFP page missing details like deadline, min & max budget etc etc.. RFP detail page should also show us the responses of the RFP given by suppliers... make the RFP detail page looks good.
    -   [X] There is no Edit RFP Functionality, implement that, I think Edit Page is also missing, try to use Add RFP Form as a reusable component
    -   [X] In "RFP Detail Page", If status is published, don't show the "Upload New Documents" as It can't be done in Publish state.
    -   [X] In "My RFPs" Page
        -   [X] Implement Pagination, send "page" and "limit" key to backend
        -   [X] Implement Filters and search properly, to implement filters properly read - "modifyGeneralFilterPrisma" and API controller - "getMyRfps"
        -   [X] We don't have bulk API feature as of now, delete that "Select all" for now
    -   [X] Implement Navbar, either on the left or on the top, whatever u feel like is ideal for the application.
    -   [X] I loggedIn as "Supplier" and in dashboard i can see "Recent RFPs" in which I can see "Draft" RFPs as well. ideally, only "Published should be shown"
    -   [X] If user has the permission "supplier_response" -> "create" is allowed, please show way to upload the response in the "RFP Detail Page".
    -   [X] If user has the permisison "rfp" -> "manage_documents" is allowed, please show the upload new documents, else hide it in "RFP Detail Page"
    -   [X] based on new websocket implementation of event in backend, update frontend accordingly
    -   [X] /responses/create has RFP ID, instead of this, it should have a dropdown of all the published rfps so that user can easily select and give response
    -   [X] /rfps/<rfp_id> page, buyer can see responses that are in draft state as well, this should not be allowed, check permission.md file if there is some issue.
    -   [X] /responses/<responses_id> page, upload new document is visible to buyer too, that's not possible, check permission json, same delete can be done by supplier not buyer, check permission json and make changes 
    -   [X] /responses/<responses_id> page , update the UI, it is missing most of the details
    -   [X] supplier is not able to see draft responses, but buyer can, please check permisison json and update the code neccessary
    -   [X] buyer can publish rfps from /rfps/<rfp_id> page, now this functionality is only in the "rfps/my" page.
    -   [X] same in /responses/<responseId> page, seller can change status draft responses to publish responses. and then it is available and send email to that rfp owner against which response is added, send notification and web socket event also.
    -   [X] on dashboard "RFP Status Distribution" that graph color of bars should be bg-primary do that
    
-   [X] **Backend Deployment:**
    -   [X] In "createRfp" service, u are not creating it correctly, read schema.prisma to get the hang of how the schema is and then implement it, for ex - current_version_id is setting as null, but that should not be the case, versions to get all the versions related to an rpf and general we will fetch only the current_version using current_version_id
    -   [X] In "getRfpById", please all the documents that are related to this "rfp_version_id" and send them to the frontend. do it same for "getMyRfps", include documents that are related to this "rfp_version_id"
    -   [X] Create "Delete Document API", this is not present, make the route => /api/rfp/documents/<document_id>, frontend will send u if the document related to rfp version or response, accordingly send rfp_verion_id or responseId... soft delete documents please....
    -   [X] Why we have not implement version and parent_document_id related to Document.... if parent_document_id is not needed, delete it.... else do something about it. same for version
    -   [X] Create more WebSocket Events, I want to make dashboard a fully functional realtime data
    -   [X] Implement Audit Trail feature as well, read my schema. I have created a table related to Audit and I think this is not implemented, implement this in backend and frontend is needed.
    -   [X] Supplier is not able to see the his responses against a rfp.. this api route is is giving empty - "/:rfp_id/responses". supplier can only see his own created rfp responses, not anybody else. buyer can see responses for the rfp that is created by him.
    -   [X] for supplier, this api is also failing, please check "/rfp/my-responses"... error - "Forbidden: You can only view published RFPs"
    -   [X] For supplier, Recent Responses in dashboard frontend should show reponses, whether draft or published.. api/dashboard check this route API
