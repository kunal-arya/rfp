# Work Done

This document summarizes the work completed on the RFP backend system.

## 1. Architecture Refactoring (Controller-Service)

- The entire authentication system has been refactored from a single router file into a modern, maintainable Controller-Service pattern.
- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) are responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services** (`src/services/`) are responsible for business logic and database interactions.
- **Routers** (`src/router/`) are now clean and only responsible for mapping routes to controllers.

## 2. Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- A flexible and powerful database-driven RBAC system was implemented.
- The `Role` enum was replaced with a `Role` model in the database.
- Each role has a `permissions` JSON field that defines fine-grained permissions for various application resources and actions.
- This allows for changing permissions dynamically without any code changes.

## 3. Database Seeding

- The database is now automatically seeded with the default "Buyer" and "Supplier" roles.
- A `prisma/seed.ts` script was created, which is run via `pnpm prisma db seed`.
- This ensures that the application has the necessary roles to function correctly on a fresh setup.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Middleware

- **JWT Protection:** A `protect` middleware (`src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`) has been created to secure endpoints and validate JSON Web Tokens.
- **Permission-Based Authorization:** A `hasPermission` middleware has been created to check if a user's role grants them permission to perform a specific action (e.g., create an RFP).

## 5. Protected Endpoint Example

- A new endpoint `POST /api/rfps` has been created to demonstrate the RBAC system.
- This route is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users with the `rfp.create` permission (i.e., Buyers).

## 6. RFP Lifecycle Management

- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to create a new RFP (`POST /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to publish an RFP (`PUT /api/rfps/:id/publish`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to browse/list published RFPs (`GET /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to submit a response to an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to review responses for an RFP (`GET /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to approve/reject a response (`PUT /api/rfps/responses/:responseId`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to upload documents for an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/documents`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to upload documents for a response (`POST /api/rfps/responses/:responseId/documents`).
- Set up data-syncing pipeline to Elasticsearch.
- Implemented basic search endpoint (`GET /api/search?q=...`).
- This includes the necessary controller and service logic to handle the requests and update the database.

**Work committed at this point with the following message:**

```
