# Work Done

This document summarizes the work completed on the RFP backend system.

## 1. Architecture Refactoring (Controller-Service)

- The entire authentication system has been refactored from a single router file into a modern, maintainable Controller-Service pattern.
- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) are responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services** (`src/services/`) are responsible for business logic and database interactions.
- **Routers** (`src/router/`) are now clean and only responsible for mapping routes to controllers.

## 2. Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- A flexible and powerful database-driven RBAC system was implemented.
- The `Role` enum was replaced with a `Role` model in the database.
- Each role has a `permissions` JSON field that defines fine-grained permissions for various application resources and actions.
- This allows for changing permissions dynamically without any code changes.

## 3. Database Seeding

- The database is now automatically seeded with the default "Buyer" and "Supplier" roles.
- A `prisma/seed.ts` script was created, which is run via `pnpm prisma db seed`.
- This ensures that the application has the necessary roles to function correctly on a fresh setup.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Middleware

- **JWT Protection:** A `protect` middleware (`src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`) has been created to secure endpoints and validate JSON Web Tokens.
- **Permission-Based Authorization:** A `hasPermission` middleware has been created to check if a user's role grants them permission to perform a specific action (e.g., create an RFP).

## 5. Protected Endpoint Example

- A new endpoint `POST /api/rfps` has been created to demonstrate the RBAC system.
- This route is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users with the `rfp.create` permission (i.e., Buyers).

## 6. RFP Lifecycle Management

- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to create a new RFP (`POST /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to publish an RFP (`PUT /api/rfps/:id/publish`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to browse/list published RFPs (`GET /api/rfps`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to submit a response to an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to review responses for an RFP (`GET /api/rfps/:id/responses`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to approve/reject a response (`PUT /api/rfps/responses/:responseId`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a buyer to upload documents for an RFP (`POST /api/rfps/:id/documents`).
- Implemented the endpoint for a supplier to upload documents for a response (`POST /api/rfps/responses/:responseId/documents`).
- Set up data-syncing pipeline to Elasticsearch.
- Implemented basic search endpoint (`GET /api/search?q=...`).
- This includes the necessary controller and service logic to handle the requests and update the database.

**Work committed at this point with the following message:**

```
feat: Implement core backend, RFP lifecycle, and API docs

- Implement core backend architecture including Controller-Service pattern, dynamic RBAC, database seeding, and auth middleware.
- Add RFP lifecycle management endpoints for creating, publishing, browsing RFPs, and submitting responses.
- Integrate Swagger for API documentation and add Swagger comments to all routes.
```

## validation library - zod
- Validation Libarary Zod is introduced and validation will happen only in controllers.
updated auth.controller.ts and rfp.controller.ts
- created src/validations folder, which include auth.validation.ts and rfp.validation.ts

## Dashboard System Implementation
- **Dashboard Router**: Created `src/router/dashboard.router.ts` with role-specific endpoints
- **Dashboard Controller**: Implemented `src/controllers/dashboard.controller.ts` with proper permission checks
- **Dashboard Service**: Created `src/services/dashboard.service.ts` with role-specific business logic
- **Buyer Dashboard**: Shows recent RFPs, responses, and RFPs needing attention
- **Supplier Dashboard**: Shows available RFPs, recent responses, and responses needing attention
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Role-specific statistics for both buyers and suppliers

## Email Notification System
- **Email Service**: Created `src/services/email.service.ts` using SendGrid
- **Notification Templates**: Implemented HTML email templates for different events
- **RFP Published**: Notifies all suppliers when a new RFP is published
- **Response Submitted**: Notifies buyers when suppliers submit responses
- **Status Changes**: Notifies suppliers when RFP status changes
- **Development Mode**: Logs emails in development when SendGrid API key is not configured

## Real-time WebSocket Notifications
- **WebSocket Service**: Created `src/services/websocket.service.ts` using Socket.IO
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- **Role-based Rooms**: Users join role-specific and personal rooms
- **Real-time Events**: 
  - `rfp_published`: Notifies suppliers of new RFPs
  - `response_submitted`: Notifies buyers of new responses
  - `rfp_status_changed`: Notifies suppliers of status changes
- **Integration**: WebSocket notifications integrated with email notifications

## Enhanced RFP Service
- **Notification Integration**: Added email and WebSocket notifications to RFP lifecycle
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and validation
- **Enhanced Security**: Proper ownership validation in all operations
- **Status Management**: Proper state transitions with validation
